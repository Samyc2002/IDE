# React-IDE
An online based IDE to execute code made using React.

## What to do

There are two main tasks that need to be done.

- [ ] Add autosuggest feature for the IDE and make it responsive too.
- [x] Add a file reader that parses the file on uploading. Also, a file upload option as well.
- [x] Add language auto select on file upload.

These are some things that can be implemented as well.

- [ ] Add a file system that the user can use to work on multiple files.
- [ ] Add a github clone repo feature that can take out files from github.

Please Read the CONTRIBUTING.md for instructions regarding code contributions.
