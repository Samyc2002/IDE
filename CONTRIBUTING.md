Please try to maintain the folder structure while contributing code. Also, ensure your code is correctly formatted and is readable. Unreadable codes will not be accepted.

Before contributing for the advanced features, make sure that the basic onces are completed. Also, some features are dependent on another so ensure that the other feature (if any) is completed before you take it up.

To contribute to the project, first visit the issues tab in guthub and take up an issue. Taking up an issue is as simple as commenting on it saying you are going to take it up. We will assign you the issue post that. Please avoid taking up issues that someone else has already taken up. Once assigned, you can make your changes and push the code. Please follow the below guidelines for the same:

- Make a fork of the project
- Once forked, make a separate branch in the fork.
- Clone the project, checkout to the branch and start working on the issue.
- Once done, add, commit and push your changes to your forked repo.
- After pushing, make a PR (pull request) to the main branch of the actual repository
- We will verify your PR post that and merge it if everything looks good. 

Please read through the README to get to know what all needs to be done. In case of any queries, use the chat platform for the team to clarify them.
